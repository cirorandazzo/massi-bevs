# Massi's Bevs

An [interactive data dashboard](massi-bevs.cirorandazzo.com) to track my brother Massimo's excessive consumption of beverages, aka "bevs"--in particular, Diet Coke ("*Vitamin DC*") & coffee. User input comes through Google Forms, and the dashboard is implemented in Plotly & Dash.

He must not have liked the insights here, since he stopped logging his beverages!

> [!NOTE]
> The dashboard is hosted via [Render](https://render.com)'s free plan. Please be patient! The website is re-spun upon reaccessing.
